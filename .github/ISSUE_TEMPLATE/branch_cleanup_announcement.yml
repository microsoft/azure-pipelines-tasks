        # ðŸ§¹ Monthly Branch Cleanup Policy Announcement
        
        ## Overview
        
        To keep the `microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks` repository clean, secure, and maintainable, we are implementing a **monthly branch cleanup policy** effective immediately.
        
        ## Policy Details
        
        - **Cleanup Schedule**: Monthly (first week of each month)
        - **Retention Period**: 24 months from last commit
        - **Protected Branches**: The following branches will NEVER be deleted:
          - `master`
          - `release*` (all release branches)
          - `Localize*` (localization branches)
          - `Localization*` (localization branches)
        
        ## Upcoming Cleanup
        
        Based on our analysis (see [logs](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/actions/runs/17490765291/job/49679840435#logs)), we have identified **approximately 1,436 branches** that are older than 24 months and will be cleaned up in the next maintenance cycle.
        
        ## Why This Policy?
        
        1. **Repository Health**: Reduces repository size and improves performance
        2. **Security**: Removes old branches that may contain outdated dependencies or security vulnerabilities
        3. **Maintainability**: Makes branch management easier for contributors and maintainers
        4. **Best Practices**: Aligns with industry standards for repository hygiene
        
        ## What You Need to Do
        
        ### If you have branches you want to preserve:
        1. **Review your branches**: Check if any of your old branches contain important work
        2. **Create PRs**: If the work is still relevant, create pull requests to merge into appropriate target branches
        3. **Tag important commits**: Use Git tags to preserve important milestones before branches are deleted
        4. **Local copies**: Ensure you have local copies of any work you want to keep
        
        ### Timeline
        - **Announcement**: Now
        - **Grace Period**: 30 days from this announcement
        - **First Cleanup**: [Date to be announced]
        - **Ongoing**: First week of every month thereafter
        
        ## Exclusion Requests
        
        If you believe a specific branch should be excluded from cleanup (beyond the protected patterns above):
        1. Reply to this issue with the branch name and justification
        2. We will review and potentially add it to the protected list
        3. Requests must be made within the 30-day grace period
        
        ## Automation
