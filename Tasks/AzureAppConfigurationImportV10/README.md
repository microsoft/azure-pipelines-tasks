### Parameters of the task:

The parameters of the task are described below. The parameters listed with a \* are required parameters for the task:

* **Azure Subscription**\*: Select the AzureRM Subscription. If none exists, then click on the **Manage** link, to navigate to the Services tab in the Administrators panel. In the tab click on **New Service Connection** and select **Azure Resource Manager** from the dropdown.

* **App Configuration Endpoint**\*: Select the endpoint of the App Configuration store to which the key-values will be pushed.

* **Configuration File Path**\*: Provide the path to your configuration file.

* **File Content Profile**\*: Provide the Configuration File's [content profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/concept-config-file). Default value is **Default**.
    - **Default**: Refers to the conventional configuration file formats that are directly consumable by applications.
    - **KVSet**:  Refers to a [file schema](https://github.com/Azure/AppConfiguration/blob/main/docs/KVSet/KVSet.v1.0.0.schema.json) that contains all properties of an App Configuration key-value

* **Import Mode**\*: Provide the import mode. The default value is **Ignore Match**.
    - **All**:  Imports all key-values in the configuration file to App Configuration.
    - **Ignore Match**: Imports only settings that have no matching key-value in App Configuration. Matching key-values are considered to be key-values with the same key, label, value, content type and tags.

* **Dry Run**: Default value is **Unchecked**
    - **Checked**: No updates will be performed to App Configuration. Instead any updates that would have been performed in a normal run will be printed to the console for review.
    - **Unchecked**: Performs any updates to App Configuration and does not print to the console.

* **Separator**: Provide the separator that should be used to flatten .json and .yml files.

* **Depth**: Provide the depth that the .json and .yml files will be flattened to.

* **Prefix**: Provide a string that will be appended to the beginning of each key pushed to App Configuration Store.

* **Label**: Provide a string that is added to each key-values as the label within the App Configuration Store.

* **Content Type**: Provide a string that is added to each key-value as the content type within the App Configuration store.

* **Exclude feature flags**: Specify whether or not any feature flags provided in the configuration file will be pushed to App Configuration.

* **Use the file path extension to determine the file format**: Specify whether or not to use the file path extension to determine the file format.

* **Delete key-values that are not included in the configuration file**: The behavior of this option depends on the configuration file [content profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/concept-config-file). Default value is **Unchecked**.
    - **Unchecked**:  Pushes all key-values from the configuration file into the App Configuration store and leaves everything else in the App Configuration store intact
    - **Checked**:
        - **Default content profile**: Removes all key-values in the App Configuration store that match both the specified prefix and label before pushing new key-values from the configuration file
        - **Kvset content profile**: Removes all key-values in the App Configuration store that are not included in the configuration file before pushing new key-values from the configuration file.

* **Tags**: Specify one or more tags that should be added to a key-value. Tags should be of a valid JSON format.
