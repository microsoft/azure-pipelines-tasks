## Upgrading Tasks to Node 16

1. Update @types packages in `package.json` dependencies.

    ```json
      "dependencies": {
        "@types/node": "^16.11.39"
      }
    ```

    > If the task does not use built-in nodejs modules (such as `fs` or `path`) directly, please remove `@types/node` from the task dependencies

2. Upgrade `azure-pipelines-task-lib` to `^4.1.0` and `azure-pipelines-tool-lib` to `^2.0.0-preview` in package.json dependencies, If a task has these packages.

3. If you have common npm packages as task dependency, make sure the `azure-pipelines-task-lib` and `azure-pipelines-tool-lib` common package dependencies have the same version as in the task.
As a possible solution you also may remove this packages versions through the `make.json` file, example:

    ```json
    {
        "rm": [
            {
                "items": [
                    "node_modules/azure-pipelines-tasks-java-common/node_modules/azure-pipelines-task-lib",
                ],
                "options": "-Rf"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Add new Node16 execution handler in task.json
    > The `target` property should be the main file targetted for the task to execute.

    <table>
    <tr>
    <th>From</th>
    <th>To</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>

    ```json
      "execution": {
        "Node10": {
          "target": "bash.js",
          "argumentFormat": ""
        }
    ```

    </td>
    <td>

    ```json
      "execution": {
        "Node10": {
          "target": "bash.js",
          "argumentFormat": ""
        },
        "Node16": {
          "target": "bash.js",
          "argumentFormat": ""
        }
    ```

    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>

## Common packages dependent on `azure-pipeline-task-lib` and `azure-pipeline-tool-lib`

Use the latest major version of a "common package" at `common-npm-packages` folder, which depends on the `azure-pipelines-task-lib` package with `^4.1.0` version. For "common package" dependent on `azure-pipeline-tool-lib`, this is `^2.0.0-preview` version.

The task-lib package uses some shared (e.g. global object) resources to operate so it may cause unexpected errors in cases when more than one version of the package is installed for a task. It happens in the case of a child package's task-lib dependency has a different version than a task's `task-lib` has. Same for `tool-lib`.

If you are planning to move some common package to common-npm-packages directory - please note that you need to update all necessary paths in this package

## Testing the changes

We need to test that the task works correctly on node 10 and node 16.
How do we need to test the changes:

- Run task unit tests (they should start on node 10 and 16 both)
- Run pipeline with task using node 10 handler
- Run pipeline with task using node 16 handler

To start a task using node 10, we can set the pipeline variable `AGENT_USE_NODE10` to `true`.

## List of known dependency issues

Major commits between Node 10-16 related to fs/child_process/os modules (gather from notable notes only) - you can use # numbers as PR ids to refer:

**Node 11**
Notable Changes:

fs:

- The fs.read() method now requires a callback.
- The previously deprecated fs.SyncWriteStream utility has been removed.

child_process
The default value of the windowsHide option has been changed to true.

**Node 12**

fs:

- use proper .destroy() implementation for SyncWriteStream
- improve mode validation
- harden validation of start option in createWriteStream()
- make writeFile consistent with readFile wrt fd
- win, fs: detect if symlink target is a directory

child_process:

- remove options.customFds
- harden fork arguments validation
- use non-infinite maxBuffer defaults

os:

- implement os.type() using uv_os_uname()
- remove os.getNetworkInterfaces()

**Node 13**
child_process:

- ChildProcess._channel (DEP0129) is now a Runtime deprecation

fs:

- The undocumented method FSWatcher.prototype.start() was removed
- Calling the open() method on a ReadStream or WriteStream now emits a runtime deprecation warning. The methods are supposed to be internal and should not be called by user code
- fs.read/write, fs.readSync/writeSync and fd.read/write now accept any safe integer as their offset parameter. The value of offset is also no longer coerced, so a valid type must be passed to the functions.

**Node 14**
os:

- (SEMVER-MAJOR) os: move tmpDir() to EOL
fs:
- (SEMVER-MAJOR) fs: deprecate closing FileHandle on garbage collection
- add fs/promises alias module (Gus Caplan)

**Node 15**
fs:

- (SEMVER-MAJOR) fs: deprecation warning on recursive rmdir
- (SEMVER-MAJOR) fs: reimplement read and write streams using stream.construct

**Node 16:**
fs:

- (SEMVER-MAJOR) fs: remove permissive rmdir recursive
- (SEMVER-MAJOR) fs: runtime deprecate rmdir recursive option
