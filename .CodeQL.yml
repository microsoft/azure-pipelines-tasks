  test:
    # Note: use only forward slash / as a path separator.
    # *  Matches any sequence of characters except a forward slash.
    # ** Matches any sequence of characters, including a forward slash. 
    # This wildcard must either be surrounded by forward slash symbols, or used as the first segment of a path. 
    # It matches zero or more whole directory segments. There is no need to use a wildcard at the end of a directory path because all sub-directories are automatically matched. 
    # That is, /anything/ matches the anything directory and all its subdirectories.
    # Always enclose the expression in double quotes if it includes *.
