### 3. Policy Documentation
**File**: `docs/branch-cleanup-policy.md`
- Complete policy document
- Implementation details
- Guidelines for contributors and maintainers
- Security and compliance benefits

### 4. Implementation Guide
**File**: `docs/branch-cleanup-README.md`
- Step-by-step instructions
- Configuration options
- Troubleshooting guide
- Maintenance procedures

### 5. Updated Preview Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/branch-cleanup-preview.yml` (updated)
- Marked as deprecated
- Points to new workflow
- Maintained for backward compatibility

## 🚀 Next Steps - What YOU Need to Do

### Step 1: Create the Announcement Issue (IMMEDIATE)
Since I cannot create GitHub issues directly, you need to:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/new/choose
2. **Select**: "Branch Cleanup Announcement" template  
3. **Review**: The pre-filled content (especially dates)
4. **Customize**: Add specific grace period end date
5. **Create**: The issue to announce the policy

### Step 2: Test the New Workflow (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Go to**: GitHub Actions → Workflows → "Branch Cleanup"
2. **Click**: "Run workflow" 
3. **Set**: 
   - months: 24
   - dry_run: true (IMPORTANT for testing)
   - create_issue: false (for testing)
4. **Run**: And verify it identifies the same ~1,436 branches

### Step 3: Schedule Grace Period (RECOMMENDED)
- **Announce**: 30-day grace period in the issue
- **Set date**: For first actual cleanup (e.g., early October 2024)
- **Monitor**: Issue for branch exclusion requests

### Step 4: Execute First Cleanup (AFTER GRACE PERIOD)
1. **Manual run** with dry_run: false
2. **OR** wait for automatic monthly schedule
3. **Monitor** the created cleanup report issue

## 📊 Expected Impact

Based on the referenced GitHub Action logs:
- **~1,436 branches** will be cleaned up initially
- **Protected branches** (master, release*, Localize*, Localization*) will be preserved
- **Monthly cleanup** will maintain repository hygiene going forward
